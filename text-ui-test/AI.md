# iP.AI

## Week 2:
This week, I used ChatGPT-5-thinking to work on the project. I started using AI for repetitive task such as making the
todo, deadline, event, and task event which I have learn on CS2030S. I also use ChatGPT to generate me a list of
exception for Level-5 task by giving what type of exception I want to throw.
## Week 3:
This week, I kept using ChatGPT-5-thinking to help with the project. I mostly use ChatGPT to help me debug Level-7 and Level-8 as
those part can get really messy and buggy. However, there is some suggestion from ChatGPT that I need to revise
since it could throw me far from the main goal or context. Then I also use ChatGPT for making most part of the javadocs
created for either class or method.

## Week 4:
This week, I am barely uses ChatGPT-5-Thinking as Level-10 task has a complete instruction and relatively new to me.
However, I am still using ChatGPT for creating some Varargs method.

## Week 5:
This week, I am still using ChatGPT-5-Thinking for my IP progress. I use ChatGPT mostly for the A-Assertion as this task 
feels repetitive. I also try to use ChatGPT to scan for code quality violation with the reference of that week code quality
material. Unfortunately ChatGPT does not seem to see clear violations.

## Week 6:
This week, I continued using ChatGPT-5-Thinking to assist me in making the GUI better. I give a clear prompt on what to 
design the GUI
